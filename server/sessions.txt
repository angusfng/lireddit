How do sessions work

Remember redis is a key value pair database

req.session.userId = user.id

1.
Inside redis Key -> value mapping
sess:fjesoifj -> { userId : 1 }

2.
Express session will set a cookie on browser 908t90df8ds
This cookie is a encrypted versyon of the redis key
Cookie is in the browser

3.
User makes a request -> cookie value is sent to server

4.
On the server, cookie value is decrypted using secret, turns into redis key
908t90df8ds -> sess:fjesoifj

5.
Make a request to redis and get the value
